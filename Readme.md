In today's era of conflicting times and modernisation, when it's totally upon us how must we lay the foundation of Education for the future generations to come. The World has seen great damage to education in the post - Covid Crises, and the team Pyraticas - 2.0 is yet again back with a great solution!

Problem Statement : 
1. With the imposing of lockdown, schools have been closed for more than an year.
2. Direct promotion had lead us to nothing but a void in education gap.
3. Interactive education has come to an end.
4. It's difficult for students to mug - up books just by sitting at home.
